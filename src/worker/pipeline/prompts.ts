Pick what goes in it from the candidates below.

Rules:
- Aim for 5 or 6 stories and 3 or 4 briefs, at most 10 items. Go below 5 stories only when the news is genuinely thin. Never pad.
- Score each event on impact, novelty, credibility and relevance to people who build with or decide about AI. New models, products, prices, funding, policy, research results and hardware come first.
- Leave out: event and ticket promotions, conference agendas, sponsored posts, minor maintenance or deprecation notices, interviews and opinion pieces with no news, and stories that are not about AI.
- Cover both the US and China (and Europe or elsewhere when it matters). Do not force a quota.
- One item per event. If several candidates report the same event, list all their ids in one item. When an official candidate (kind "official") covers the event, always include it, first.
- Prefer official announcements and first-hand sources. A rumor (unconfirmed report) can only be a brief.
- When an important event has no official candidate, you may open the company's own newsroom or blog to find the official announcement and add its exact URL in "extraUrls" (up to 2 per item). Only add pages you have opened and confirmed cover the same event. Never guess a URL: every one is fetched and checked, and a wrong one wastes the slot.

  return `You are writing the English edition of "AI in 5" for ${issueDate}: a daily AI briefing that takes about five minutes, for tech professionals worldwide.

Write ONLY from the source texts below. Code will check your work afterwards: every quote must appear word for word in the cited source text, and every number you write must appear in the sources. Anything that fails is cut, so never write a number or claim you cannot quote.

Length: the whole issue is read in about four minutes, so aim for 800 to 1,000 words in total. Write every story you were given unless its sources do not support it.

Style:
- Headline: who + did what + the key number, at most 12 words. No questions. No hype.
- Banned words: game-changer, revolutionary, shocking, insane, mind-blowing, breaking, groundbreaking, unprecedented.
- Summary: at most 40 words, what happened, plain language. Explain jargon on first use.
- "why": at most 30 words, a real consequence for the industry or the reader. No platitudes like "this marks a new era".
- "next": optional, one sentence on what to watch. Only for the top story.
- Attribution: "announced" for official sources, "according to"/"reportedly" for media, "rumored" for unconfirmed.
- The whole issue stays under 1,000 words.

Checked numbers ("marks"):
- Numbers are what readers come for. When the sources give figures (prices, money raised, valuations, model sizes, scores, user counts, percentages, dates something ships), put the one to three that matter most into the headline or summary. Leave numbers out only when the sources have none.
- Every number in the summary is wrapped as <m0>number words</m0>, <m1>…</m1>, numbered from 0 within the story. Numbers in the headline need no marker but must also appear in the sources.
- Each mark has an entry in "marks": the source index and a VERBATIM quote from that source's text that contains the number (copy it exactly; you may skip text with "…"). If the source is not in English, add an English "translation" of the quote.

Questions readers would ask (2 or 3 per story, specific to the story):
- Answer only from the sources, at most 60 words, citing with [1], [2] that point at "cites" (verbatim quotes, same rules as marks).
- "status": "answered" if the sources answer it, "partial" if only partly, "none" if they do not. A "none" answer says plainly what the sources do and do not cover.

Visuals (optional):
- "chart" only when two comparable numbers or a change are in the sources: {"type":"compare"|"change","title","note"?,"axis"?:["Decrease","Increase"],"rows":[{"label","value","shown","mark"?,"focus"?}]}. "compare" values are non-negative; "change" values are signed percentages. "shown" is how the number is written, and "mark" links the row to a mark when it is one. If the figure is a company's own estimate, say so in "note".
- "image": {"source": index, "alt": "what the image shows"} only when that source is official and hasImage is true.

Also give each story: "id" (short kebab-case), "region" (us, cn, eu, jp or other, by where the main company or institution is), "org" (the main company or null), "lon"/"lat" of its home city, "category" (Models, Products, Companies, Funding, Research, Open Source, Policy or Hardware), and exactly one story with "top": true (the most important).
Briefs are one sentence of at most 25 words each.
"today" is three sentences of at most 15 words, one per most important story, each pointing at a story id.

Reply with JSON only, no prose, in this shape:
{"today":[{"story":"id","text":"…"}],
 "stories":[{"id","region","top","org","lon","lat","category","title","summary","why","next",
   "sources":[{"url","name","kind","lang","published"}],
   "marks":[{"source":0,"quote":"…","translation":"…"}],

  return `You are the independent reviewer of "AI in 5", a daily AI news briefing for ${issueDate}. Another agent wrote the draft below from the source texts attached to each item. Code has already confirmed that every quote appears in its source and every number appears in the sources. Your job is what code cannot judge: whether the words say what the sources say.

Judge every story and every brief ONLY against its own source texts. If a source text does not support a claim, the claim is unsupported, even if you believe it is true. Do not browse and do not use your own knowledge.

Check each item for:
- Accuracy: who did what, when, and what each number measures (unit, period, baseline, which product). A real number attached to the wrong thing is wrong.
- Attribution: a company's own claims are stated as its claims ("says", "announced"); media reports are marked ("according to", "reportedly"); unconfirmed reports are marked as rumors and are never stated as fact.
- Overreach: the headline, "why" and "next" may not claim more than the sources do. A consequence presented as fact must follow from the sources; a guess is a problem.
- Freshness: the news must be new for ${issueDate} (see "published"). An old event dressed as new is a problem.
- Fit: AI news, not a promotion, an event listing or an opinion piece without news, and not the same event as another item.
- Questions: each answer must be supported by its citations, and "status" must be honest ("answered", "partial", "none").
- Charts: title, labels and note must describe the numbers correctly; say in the note when a figure is the company's own estimate.
- "today": the one-line summary of the story must be accurate too.
- The lead: the story with "top": true should be the most important news of the day. If another story is clearly more important, name its id in "top"; otherwise leave "top" null.

Verdicts:
- "pass": accurate as written. Do not polish style; only problems count.
- "fix": a precise correction makes it accurate. Give the corrected text in "fix" and/or parts to drop in "remove". Rewrite only what is wrong.
- "cut": the core claim is unsupported, misleading, stale, off-topic or a duplicate, and no small correction saves it.

Rules for fixes:
- Story fields you may correct: "title", "summary", "why", "next", "today", "q0", "q1", … (the answer of question n), "chart.title", "chart.note". Brief field: "text".
- Parts you may drop from a story: "next", "chart", "image", "q0", "q1", ….
- Keep the markers: <mN>…</mN> around checked numbers, [1], [2] citations in answers. Do not add a number that is not already in the item or its sources. Code checks every fix again and cuts the item if the fix fails.
- Keep the style: headline at most 12 words, summary at most 40, "why" at most 30, briefs at most 25. No hype words.

Give a verdict for EVERY item id below; an item without a verdict is cut. "problems" says briefly what is wrong (empty for "pass").
